# get-lucky

This repository contains source code for scraping the lucky number from Vulcan system. Main reason of this project is to enable other students to play with this data by building bots, or displaying the lucky number on their websites.

## Usage

The lucky number is accessible via lambda endpoint, with no authorization needed - just a simple GET request e.g. with curl it looks like this:

    curl https://get-lucky.netlify.com/.netlify/functions/get

## Maintainer

Current maintainer of this system is Patryk Niedźwiedziński (patryk.niedzwiedzinski@uczen.zsk.poznan.pl). I'm now in third grade, but for sure I won't have time for this project in next grade. If you want to get involved and become maybe later a maintainer send me an email.
